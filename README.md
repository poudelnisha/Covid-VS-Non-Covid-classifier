# Covid-VS-Non-Covid-classifier

It was 2020! Confined at home people were getting new perspectives!!!
FAKE News and Tweets were prevalent and most talked about!! 
## Here, we the students of Machine Learning wanted to see if we can extract any meaningful information about COVID from tweets.
COVID related data were limited. So, we created our own dataset and implemented three machine learning model to best classify the COVID tweets from Non COVID tweets.
Given that our model has a good accuracy, we concluded that this model can be further used for Natural Language Processing to extract important information by Public health stakeholders and government bodies.
